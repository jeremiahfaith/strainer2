# strainer2
kmer-based software for detecting bacterial strain genomes inside metagenomes

The Strainer2 software is an updated version of the Strainer workflow https://bitbucket.org/faithj02/strainer-metagenomics/src/master/README.md
that identifies rare kmers in a bacterial strain genome and searches for those rare kmers in one or more metagenomes to determine if a strain
is present or absent in a metagenome.
